TL;DR:

* Clone into a directory.
* Put that directory onto your PATH.
* @vw <env>@ will now create/activate @<env>@ (they live in ~/envs).
* @vw -w . <env>@ will set @.@ (or some other directory) as the "workdir" for @env@. You will automatically be cd'd into there when activating the virtualenv with @vw@.
